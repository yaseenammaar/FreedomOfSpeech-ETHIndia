Freedom Of Speech: Giving right to speak, One person at a time!

# First Law of Metaverse | Speak & Get Paid to Shut Up

## Note: It is not destined to act like a ad board, where anyone can put marketing stuff and let other people watch.

Main idea of this project is to provide freedom of speech in a different manner. As we know Elon Musk bought twitter and said he will allow freedom of speech, that's alright but there is no monetary benefit to user.

FreedomOfSpeech.lol allows one person at a time to display any URL, currently supporting PNG, JPG and GIF. (will add YouTube videos and other options later)


### Working: Each time a user changes the URL the price of next bid increases by 20% and the previous user gets his capital back with fraction of profit.

For example: If someone changed URL for 1 ETH then he/she will get 1.10 ETH or more, if his content get replaced. (We calculated, user will not be in loss if wheel keeps on running!)

# Usage

1. Metamask wallet with some Ether (currently it's on Mumbai testnet)
2. Visit https://freedomofspeech.lol
3. Scroll down to the bottom
4. Enter URL of any PNG/JPG/GIF
5. Hit "Change"
6. Wait for transaction 
7. Done! You will get to see your content on the site.
